                I work at the Texas Tribune as the Director of Technology.
                We're a non-profit, online-only news organization that covers
                politics and policy for the state of Texas.  If trying to create
                a sustainable model for real, in-depth news coverage is
                important to you, please become a member.
              </p>

              <p>
                I want to point out that we're working <em>toward</em> this, but
                aren't there yet.

            <h2>Web/HTTP</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              The web, and in particular the protocol that powers the web.  The
              entire system is meant to be distributed, but we've started
              building the web in a way that isn't.  Think of all the walled
              gardens that are being created now.  Remind you of anything?  Did
              someone say AOL, or was it CompuServe that I heard?

            <h2>Theory</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              This is a lot of theory.  I'm not going to dive into a bunch of
              tools and cookbooks.  It's the principles that you can apply to
              your systems, regardless of what the underlying programming
              language is.

            <aside class="notes">
              JSON is becoming the language agnostic way of representing data
              online.  The fact that it has JavaScript in the name is almost
              irrelevant now all three of the major languages on the backend of
              the web (PHP, Python, and Ruby) have JSON available in native and
              C-extensions for faster parsing.

            <img src="./images/basic-server.svg">

            <aside class="notes">
              This is where everyone starts.  You have one server, it takes a
              request, processes it, then sends it back to the user.

              <p>
                Next, people end up here.  This is probably familiar to those who've
                used systems with a supervisor model.  Most popular setup is Nginx to
                (G)Unicorn and either Django or Rails.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that the app servers don't necessarily have to be on different
                machines.  You could run one server with 5 workers.  You can also run
                5 servers with 5 workers each, or any other combination that might make
                sense for your needs.

            <aside class="notes">
              You have to scale <em>everything</em>.  What if it's just one small part
              of your application that needs to handle massive load?  Why scale up the
              resources to build everything when that's all you need?

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>
                Monolithic systems suck.  One server that does everything means you need
                everything in order to test everything.  There's no separation of concerns
                so to make changes to your users, you need to have a working search index
                so everything starts up.
              </p>

              <p>
                That doesn't even mention trying to deal with clients with needs other
                than browsers.
